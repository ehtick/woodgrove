## Support

This sample application and its source code created by Microsoft to demonstrate some of the Microsoft Entra Extrnal ID user flows. The application and its source code is not supported under any Microsoft standard support program or service. If you find a bug, notice something but are not sure how to solve it, or want to provide product feedback, use the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/woodgrove-groceries/issues) tab at the top of the page. You can also @mention collaborators who have access to this repository in an issue to draw their attention to a comment. 

## Using the source code

The objective of this project is to demonstrate various authentication user experiences. While it is possible to download and run the app locally, it's not recommended because the app is designed to support multiple flows within a single application, whereas a typical app utilizes a single sign-in flow. 

Examples of Microsoft Entra External ID are available at <https://aka.ms/eeid/samples>. For these examples, we provide instructions on how to download and use the samples or create your own application based on common authentication and authorization scenarios, development languages, and platforms.
